As a less mainstream language, Erlang doesn't generally have a great out-of-the-box developer experience. As someone new to Erlang (and the BEAM in general), who also uses Neovim as their daily driver, I wanted to see whether I could setup a functional Neovim configuration that would give me IDE-like features for Erlang. I specifically wanted the following:

<br />

- Code formatting on save
- Hover documentation
- Goto definition
- Code actions
- Quickly jumping to workspace symbols

  <br />

Luckily, there is [an erlang language server](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls) which has pretty much everything you need out of the box. Once you install it (and `erlang_ls` is in your `$PATH`), configuring it for Neovim is actually pretty simple. I adapted my OCaml configuration a bit, and it resulted in something that worked. The plugin spec is as follows.

```lua title="erlang.lua"
return {
  setup = function()
    local lsp = require "lspconfig"

    local c = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()
    c.textDocument.completion.completionItem.snippetSupport = true
    c.textDocument.completion.completionItem.resolveSupport = {
      properties = {
        "documentation",
        "detail",
        "additionalTextEdits",
      },
    }

    local on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
      -- enable completion triggered by <C-x><C-o>
      -- vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(bufnr, "omnifunc", "v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc")

      if client.server_capabilities.documentFormattingProvider then
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufWritePre", {
          group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("Format", { clear = true }),
          buffer = bufnr,
          callback = function() vim.lsp.buf.formatting_seq_sync() end,
        })
      end
      --
      -- code lens
      if client.resolved_capabilities and client.resolved_capabilities.code_lens then
        local codelens = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("LSPCodeLens", { clear = true })
        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "BufEnter", "InsertLeave", "CursorHold" }, {
          group = codelens,
          callback = function() vim.lsp.codelens.refresh() end,
          buffer = bufnr,
        })
      end

      local original_progress_handler = vim.lsp.handlers["$/progress"]
      local initialized = false

      -- Silence most of the annoying messages from the LSP outside of initialization messages
      vim.lsp.handlers["$/progress"] = function(err, result, ctx, config)
        if result.value and result.value.title and result.value.title:match "Indexing OTP" then
          return
        end

        if not initialized then
          original_progress_handler(err, result, ctx, config)
          if result.value and result.value.kind == "end" or result.value == "Indexing OTP" then initialized = true end
        else
          return
        end
      end
    end

    local capabilities = require("cmp_nvim_lsp").default_capabilities(c)

    return {
      cmd = { "erlang_ls" },
      filetypes = { "erlang" },
      root_dir = lsp.util.root_pattern "*.erl",
      on_attach = on_attach,
      capabilities = capabilities,
    }
  end,
}
```

You can import it like a normal lua module and call `setup` where necessary. Personally, I use [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/), so I added it to the config table as follows:

```lua title="astrolsp.lua"
return {
  opts = {
    -- ...
    config = {
      erlang_ls = erlang.setup(),
    }
    -- ...
  }
}
```

Anyway, I know this was short, but I thought this was cool and might help someone else in the future. Also, it's been two weeks since I've written a post and I don't want the two people who read this blog to think I've abandoned it (I haven't!). See you next time (:
